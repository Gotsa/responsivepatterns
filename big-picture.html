                    <h3>The Explosion!</h3>
                    <p><em>Grand Prize Winner and 1st Place/Nature:</em> The subject&#8217;s name is Busaba, a well cared for Indochinese Tigress whose home is at Khao Kheow Open Zoo, Thailand. I had taken many portraits of Busaba previously and it was becoming more and more difficult to come up with an image that appeared any different to the others. Which is why I took to observing her more carefully during my visits in the hope of capturing something of a behavioral shot. The opportunity finally presented itself while watching Busaba enjoying her private pool then shaking herself dry. In all humility I have to say that Mother Nature smiled favorably on me that day! <small>(Photo and caption by Ashley Vincent/National Geographic Photo Contest)</small></p>

                    <p><em>Viewer&#8217;s Choice/Places:</em> Chipping ice off an iceberg is a common way for the Inuit community to retrieve fresh drinking water while on the land. During a weekend long hunting trip, we came upon this majestic iceberg frozen in place. It was a perfect opportunity to grab enough ice and drinking water for the remainder of the trip. <small>(Photo and caption by Adam Coish/National Geographic Photo Contest)</small></p>

                    <p><em>Viewer&#8217;s Choice/People:</em> A race that follows in the path of the famous explorer Roald Amundsen brings the contestants to the Hardangervidda Mountainplateu, Norway. 100km across the plateau, the exact same route Amundsen used to prepare for his South Pole expedition in 1911 is still used by explorers today. Amundsen did not manage to cross the plateau and had to turn back because of bad weather. He allegedly said that the attempt to cross Hardangervidda was just as dangerous and hard as the conquering of the South Pole. <small>(Photo and caption by Kai-Otto Melau/National Geographic Photo Contest)</small></p>

                    <p><em>Viewer&#8217;s Choice/Nature:</em> Everyday in Mara starts with something new and different and day ends with memorable experiences with spectacular photographs. I was very lucky sighting and photographing Malaika - the name of female Cheetah and her cub. She is well known for its habit to jump on vehicles. She learned that from her mother Kike, and Kike from her mother, Amber. Like her mother she is teaching lessons to her cub. Teaching lessons means the addition of another moment for tourists. This is one of the tender moments between Malaika and her cub. I was very lucky to capture that moment. <small>(Photo and caption by Sanjeev Bhor/National Geographic Photo Contest)</small></p>

These measures are implemented to those thought to be violent, uncontrollable and dangerous. <small>(Photo and caption by Wendell Phillips/National Geographic Photo Contest)</small></p>
