    <h1>Responsive Image Markup Patterns</h1>
    <p>Documenting useful ways to include images in a responsive context.</p>
    <p>Lovingly crafted by <a href="http://paulrobertlloyd.com/">Paul Robert Lloyd</a> and <a href="http://joshemerson.co.uk/">Josh Emerson</a>.</p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>Please study the markup in these examples, and view with JavaScript disabled.</p>

    <h3><a href="article-listing.html">Article Listing</a></h3>
    <p>An image to illustrate the headline story is considered valuable content. Images for subsequent stories are considered less valuable, but references to thumbnail images are provided so that these can be shown in certain states.</p>
    <p>In this example, thumbnail images for subsequent stories are not shown when a user views the component on a display that is narrower than 640px.</p>

    <h3><a href="image-gallery-1.html">Image Gallery 1</a></h3>
    <p>As a gallery of images, it&#8217;s essential these can be seen by any user viewing this component. High resolution versions of these images (1440&#215;960 pixels) are non-essential however, so are linked to from each thumbnail (360&#215;240 pixels).</p>
    <p>In this example, when we enhance the design with JavaScript, we use the thumbnails as image placeholders, that appear before the large resolution images have been fully downloaded.</p>

    <h3><a href="image-gallery-2.html">Image Gallery 2</a></h3>
    <p>As a gallery of images, it&#8217;s essential these can be seen by any user viewing this component. High resolution versions of these images (1440&#215;960 pixels) are non-essential however, so are linked to from each thumbnail (360&#215;240 pixels).</p>
    <p>In this example, when we enhance the design with JavaScript, we retain the thumbnail images and include them in the carousel interface. We also use them as placeholder images, appearing before the large resolution images have been fully downloaded.</p>
